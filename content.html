<p>Complex numbers extend the familiar system of real numbers (integers, fractions, and decimals) by introducing the concept of <em>imaginary numbers</em>. They allow us to represent solutions to equations that have no real number solutions, such as finding the square root of a negative number.</p>

<h2>The Imaginary Unit</h2>

<p>The foundation of complex numbers is the <strong>imaginary unit</strong>, denoted by the symbol <em>i</em> (or sometimes <em>j</em> in engineering contexts). It is defined by the equation:</p>

<p>$$i^2 = -1$$</p>

<p>This means that $i$ is the square root of $-1$: $i = \sqrt{-1}$. While this may seem strange (no real number, when squared, gives -1), imaginary numbers are just as valid a mathematical concept as real numbers, and they have many practical applications in physics, engineering, and other fields.</p>

<h2>Definition and Representation</h2>

<p>A <strong>complex number</strong> is any number that can be written in the form:</p>

<p>$a + bi$</p>

<p>where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. The number $a$ is called the <strong>real part</strong>, and $b$ is called the <strong>imaginary part</strong> (or more precisely, the coefficient of the imaginary unit).</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$3 + 2i$ is a complex number with real part 3 and imaginary part 2</li>
<li>$-1 + 4i$ is a complex number with real part -1 and imaginary part 4</li>
<li>$5 + 0i = 5$ is a complex number (it's purely real)</li>
<li>$0 + 3i = 3i$ is a complex number (it's purely imaginary)</li>
<li>$0 + 0i = 0$ is a complex number (it's zero)</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that real numbers are a special case of complex numbers where the imaginary part is zero, and purely imaginary numbers are complex numbers where the real part is zero.</p>
